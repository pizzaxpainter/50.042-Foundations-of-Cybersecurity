Question: Explain one limitation of using RSA attacks
 
Answer: 
RSA is an intensive computation algorithm. It is very slow compared to other algorithms especially for large amounts of data and on low-end devices. 
The high security of RSA relies on factoring large integers which makes it difficult for attackers to break the encryption.
